              Hi, Iâ€™m Rama Khabbaz! Iâ€™m passionate about front-end development and UX design, and Iâ€™m excited about building interfaces that solve real problems. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Human Computer Interaction.

              One of my strengths is end-to-end thinking, carefully considering how users engage with a product to create seamless experiences. I bring a high level of organization and attention to detail to everything I do, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and grow. I pick up new concepts quickly and enjoy challenging myself to step outside my comfort zone through new programming languages and courses.
            </p>

              As President of the Girls Who Code College Loop at Georgia Tech, I lead social events for members, organize networking opportunities with corporate sponsors, and coordinate volunteer programs where members mentor younger students interested in computer scienceâ€”finding just as much joy in helping others grow as I do in growing myself.
